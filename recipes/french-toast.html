    <p>French toast is a classic breakfast dish made by dipping slices of bread in a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and a touch of cinnamon or vanilla, then frying them until golden and crispy. The result is a warm, slightly crispy exterior with a soft, custardy interior. Often served with a drizzle of maple syrup, fresh fruit, powdered sugar, or a sprinkle of cinnamon, French toast is a comforting, versatile dish that can be enjoyed sweet or savory. It’s the perfect way to transform simple ingredients into a delicious and satisfying meal.! Find the full recipe below:</p>
