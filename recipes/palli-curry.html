    <h2>Kerala Style Palli Curry</h2>
    <p>APalli curry is a flavorful and aromatic South Indian dish made with ground peanuts as the star ingredient. The rich, creamy texture of the peanuts forms the base of the curry, which is then combined with a mix of spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili, creating a deliciously tangy and spicy sauce. Often cooked with vegetables or meats like chicken or lamb, the dish can vary depending on the region, but it always delivers a satisfying balance of heat and nuttiness. Served with rice, roti, or paratha, palli curry is a comforting and hearty meal that is perfect for any occasion.! Find the full recipe below:</p>
